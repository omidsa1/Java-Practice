Problem Definition:

An anagram to a given string is another string (of same length) that contains the exact set of 
characters from the string with a potentially different ordering.

For example "listen" is an anagram to "silent".

Given two strings of the same length as input our program should find the minimum number of characters to be altered 
from the second string to make it an anagram of the first string. It is guaranteed that none of input strings include repeatative characters.

Use Stream API for solving the problem.
