Quick Note on Directory Structure and Problem Descriptions:

Each directory contains two files (and very likely a not git-ignored .class file auto-created in the compilation step): 
1- A runnable (main method containing) java file: [problem_name].java
2- A text file describing the problem, a sample input and a sample output: problem.txt
