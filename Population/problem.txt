Problem Definition:


Given the City and Country classes, write a program to find most populated city of each country. The program should connect to DB using JDBC and query it for retrieving data and populating POJOs.

Note: Due to DB setup requirements and packaging matters, the program needs additional components and libraries to run. Please check and correct the package name too, if necessary.
