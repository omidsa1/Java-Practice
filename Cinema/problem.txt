Problem Definition:


Given the Genre, Director and Movie classes, write a program to find number of movies of each director. The program should connect to DB using JDBC and query it for retrieving data and populating POJOs.

Note: Due to DB setup requirements and packaging matters, the program needs additional components and libraries to run. Please check and correct the package name too, if necessary.
