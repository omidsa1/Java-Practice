Problem Definition:

Given a list of numbers, output a list in which the number at each index of returned list is the maximum 
of numbers to the right of that index in the input list.

As the last index has no right max, the last index of the output list should be -1.

Input: 
{16, 17, 6, 2, 5, 3}

Output: 
[17, 6, 5, 5, 3, -1]
